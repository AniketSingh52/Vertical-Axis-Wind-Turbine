## 📌 Project Overview

The **Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT)** project is an innovative solution to harness wind energy generated by fast-moving trains and highway traffic. By installing vertical axis turbines alongside rail tracks and roads, this system can effectively convert kinetic wind energy into electricity — offering a sustainable power alternative for public infrastructure.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Harvest wind energy from the turbulence caused by fast-moving trains and vehicles.
- Reduce reliance on conventional energy sources by powering station systems and street lighting.
- Promote sustainable, renewable energy innovations in transportation infrastructure.
- Enable scalable implementation across urban and rural corridors.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Innovative Application**: Converts unused wind energy from train motion into electricity.
- ✅ **Vertical Axis Design**: Efficient for all wind directions, ideal for roadside and trackside setups.
- ✅ **Eco-Friendly**: Zero emissions and low maintenance.
- ✅ **Scalable & Cost-Effective**: Can be deployed in multiples for increased energy output.
- ✅ **Highway Compatible**: Not limited to railway — works on roads with heavy traffic too.
